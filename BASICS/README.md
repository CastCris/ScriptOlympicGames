# Some Usefull things for competitive porgramming
Hello everyone


Today(13/08/25), I have seen some resolutions for programming exercices, the OBI resolutions, and I dont understand nothing of the it code.
Well, for whose that are novices when you have a porblem, you can use some approachs. Firstly, thought about the parcials, in OBI case, after, focus in the most simplest and clear solution and check the BIG O of your code.
At this point, ALLRIGHT, but when you written a code for others see, want or no, you need follow some rules. Among it, use plain variable names, a consisten code and some comments when the situation goes hard.
But the OBI dont make this, really, sometime look the developer dont know develop a code. 


So, with some love in my heart for whose are in this situation, and for me, I can forget everything of a day for other, I do this dir in this project. Sincerely, I hope it help your in any way <3.

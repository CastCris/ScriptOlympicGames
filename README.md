# Now is starting the Script Olimpic Games!
Hello competitors and non-competitors!

Welcome to the Git repository ScriptOlympicGames! 

Here, you can find solutions to several popular open contests, such as, only able for now, OBI( Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics). I hope you, dear reader, can use these codes to expand your knowledge and improve your critical thinking, beyond  answering any question about these challenges.

For a best stream of the code, I created the file run. It is a file written in shellscript language. You can quickly run any existing file able to compile typing:

```bash
./run -f my_file.c
```

If you have any question about it, type:

```bash
./run --help
```
